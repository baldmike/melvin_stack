# melvin_stack
MELViN stack - MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.JS  ---  The L stands for "love".

cd into project...

You'll need MondoDB running. I recommend using Homebrew:

`brew tap mongodb/brew`

`brew install mongodb-community`

then start it as a service:

` brew services start mongodb-community`

cd into server

`npm install`

`npm run start`

cd into client

`npm install`

`npm run start`

Navigate to localhost:8080
